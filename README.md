# Java Course Project

This project is part of a Java course and demonstrates core concepts of Java development, including database operations using the Repository pattern and containerization with Docker.

## Introduction

This project is a Java-based application that performs various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database. It follows best practices by implementing the Repository design pattern, which promotes separation of concerns and a more modular, testable code structure. The application also includes Docker support to enable easy deployment and environment management.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **Docker**: Used to containerize the application, making it easy to deploy and manage across different environments.
- **Repository Pattern**: This project follows the Repository design pattern, which abstracts the data access layer, making the codebase easier to maintain and test.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database used for data persistence in the project.

## Features

- Database operations using CRUD functionality.
- Repository pattern implementation for managing data access.
- Docker setup for easy deployment.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project, make sure you have the following installed:
- **Java** (JDK 11 or higher recommended)
- **Docker**
